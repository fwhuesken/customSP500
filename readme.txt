To do:

**~~Weighting~~**
- ~~Create json file from csv in selection.py (makes it easier when I later generate json in JS) which includes weights~~
- ~~rewrite final_selection() to work with json file~~
- ~~rewrite buy() to work with new final_selection()~~
- ~~Check if weights and minimum price work in buying power check~~

**~~GUI~~**
- ~~List all fractionable shares
**=> Use PTL approach to get data from database, then use replit approach to display it**~~

- ~~add sp500~~~
- ~~add nasdaq100~~~
- ~~add dropdown to select different indexes~~~
- **NEXT**: display selected data
- use JOIN to display constituents of sp500 and nasdaq together
- let user select which ones to drop





**Misc**
- Assign weights (% and $)
- Show minimum per month with current selection
- change sp500.py so it accepts all csv (make sure to assign table name based on csv name)
- display multi dropdown on index.html to 

**ETF**

- Store ETF composition in table
- Calculate current overall price for ETF (and change)
