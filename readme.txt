To do:

**~~Weighting~~**
- ~~Create json file from csv in selection.py (makes it easier when I later generate json in JS) which includes weights~~
- ~~rewrite final_selection() to work with json file~~
- ~~rewrite buy() to work with new final_selection()~~
- ~~Check if weights and minimum price work in buying power check~~

**~~GUI~~**
- ~~List all fractionable shares
**=> Use PTL approach to get data from database, then use replit approach to display it**~~

**either**
- exclude all ETF, Depositary

**or**
- only show nasdaq and/or sp500 and let user remove all stocks he doesn't want to add (better)


**Misc**
- Assign weights (% and $)
- Show minimum per month with current selection

**ETF**

- Store ETF composition in table
- Calculate current overall price for ETF (and change)
