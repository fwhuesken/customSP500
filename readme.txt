To do:

**Weighting**
- ~~Create json file from csv in selection.py (makes it easier when I later generate json in JS) which includes weights~~
- ~~rewrite final_selection() to work with json file~~
- rewrite buy() to work with new final_selection()
- Check if weights and minimum price work in buying power check 
- Adjust: first satisfy minimum price, then equal share until weight is reached


**ETF**

Calculate current overall price for ETF (and change)
