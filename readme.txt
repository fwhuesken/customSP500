To do:

**Weighting**
- ~~Create json file from csv in selection.py (makes it easier when I later generate json in JS) which includes weights~~
- ~~rewrite final_selection() to work with json file~~
- ~~rewrite buy() to work with new final_selection()~~
- ~~Check if weights and minimum price work in buying power check~~
- Adjust: first satisfy minimum price, then equal share until weight is reached


**ETF**

- Calculate current overall price for ETF (and change)

**GUI**
- List all fractionable shares
- Assign weights (% and $)
- Show minimum per month with current selection

- Grab database code from fullstack tutorial
- figure out how to host on replit (maybe with replit db?)
